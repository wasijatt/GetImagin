### Start Using GSAP in 4 Simple Steps

Here’s how you can add GSAP to your project:

#### Step 1: Install GSAP
Choose a method:

**Option 1: Use a CDN**
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/gsap.min.js"></script>

```

**Option 2: Install via npm**
```bash

npm install gsap


```

#### Step 2: Try a Basic Animation

Here’s an example of moving a box to the right:


```html



<div class="box" style="width:100px; height:100px; background:blue;"></div>

<script>
  gsap.to(".box", {
    x: 300, // Moves the box 300px to the right
    duration: 2, // Animation takes 2 seconds
    ease: "power2.out" // Adds a smooth effect
  });
</script>



```

#### Step 3: Create a Sequence with Timelines
Timelines let you create a series of animations:
```html
<script>
  const timeline = gsap.timeline();

  timeline
    .to(".box", { x: 300, duration: 1 })
    .to(".box", { y: 150, duration: 1 })
    .to(".box", { rotation: 360, duration: 1 });
</script>
```
This example moves a box to the right, then down, and finally rotates it.

#### Step 4: Add Scroll Effects
Use the **ScrollTrigger** plugin for scroll-based animations:



```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/ScrollTrigger.min.js"></script>

<script>
  gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

  gsap.to(".box", {
    scrollTrigger: ".box", // Animation starts on scroll
    x: 500,
    duration: 2
  });
</script>


```

2. **Test on Phones**: Make sure animations work well on mobile devices.
3. **Lazy Load**: Load animations only when needed to improve speed.
